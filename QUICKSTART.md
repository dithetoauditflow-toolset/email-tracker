## Common Email Server Settings

### Microsoft Outlook/Exchange
- **IMAP**: outlook.office365.com:993
- **SMTP**: smtp.office365.com:587
- **Note**: Enable IMAP in Outlook settings
- **Auth**: May need app password

### Google Workspace
- **IMAP**: imap.gmail.com:993
- **SMTP**: smtp.gmail.com:587
- **Note**: Enable "Less secure app access" or use app password
- **2FA**: Must use app-specific password

### Custom Email Server
- Contact your IT department for:
  - IMAP server address and port
  - SMTP server address and port
  - Whether to use app passwords

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect to email server"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify IMAP/SMTP host and port
2. Check credentials (try logging in via webmail)
3. Check if your email provider requires app passwords
4. Ensure firewall allows outbound connections on IMAP/SMTP ports
5. For corporate email, check with IT if IMAP is enabled

### No Emails Syncing

**Solutions**:
1. Verify company email addresses are correct in your company list
2. Check that emails exist in the date range (last 30 days)
3. Review internal domain settings (may be filtering too much)
4. Check sync status for error messages

### "Database locked" Error

This shouldn't happen with per-auditor databases, but if it does:
1. Close all other instances of the app
2. Restart the application
3. Contact admin if persists

## Tips

- **Initial Sync**: First sync fetches last 30 days of emails (configurable)
- **Subsequent Syncs**: Only fetch new emails since last sync
- **Working Days**: Calculation excludes weekends and public holidays
- **Data Isolation**: Each auditor's data is completely separate
- **Export**: Download overdue contacts as CSV for Excel
