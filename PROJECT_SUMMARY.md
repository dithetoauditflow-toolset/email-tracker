## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### For Admins

1. **User Management**
   - Create/delete auditor accounts
   - View auditor statistics
   - Monitor sync status across all auditors

2. **Settings Configuration**
   - Set follow-up threshold (working days)
   - Manage internal domains to exclude
   - System-wide settings

3. **Overview Dashboard**
   - Total auditors count
   - Per-auditor email and company statistics
   - Last sync timestamps

### For Auditors

1. **Company List Management**
   - Upload CSV with company contacts
   - Edit company list in-app
   - Dynamic add/remove rows

2. **Email Synchronization**
   - Configure IMAP/SMTP settings (encrypted storage)
   - One-click sync from company email server
   - Incremental sync (only new emails after first run)
   - Automatic filtering of internal domains

3. **Follow-Up Tracking**
   - View overdue contacts (configurable threshold)
   - Working days calculation (excludes weekends/holidays)
   - Export overdue list to CSV
   - Real-time sync statistics

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions

**Problem**: SQLite concurrency issues with multiple auditors  
**Solution**: Per-auditor databases (`auditor_{id}.db`)
- `main.db` - Users, settings (admin-only writes, rare)
- `auditor_1.db`, `auditor_2.db`, etc. - Isolated per auditor
- **Result**: Zero write conflicts, natural scaling

**Security**:
- Passwords: bcrypt hashing
- Email credentials: Fernet (AES) encryption
- Sessions: Streamlit session state management

**Data Integrity**:
- Unique message IDs prevent duplicates
- Incremental sync with checkpoints
- Foreign key relationships maintained

---

## 📊 Test Results

```
✅ PASS - Dependencies (all packages installed)
✅ PASS - Imports (all modules load correctly)
✅ PASS - Database (schema creation works)
✅ PASS - Utilities (working day calculations accurate)
✅ PASS - Encryption (credentials secure)

Passed: 5/5 tests
```

## 🚀 Next Steps to Use

### 1. Create Admin Account

```bash
python create_admin.py
```

Enter your admin username and password.

### 2. Start the Application

**Option A - Quick start:**
```bash
start.bat
```

**Option B - Manual:**
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### 3. First Login

- Open http://localhost:8501
- Login with admin credentials
- Add auditor accounts
- Configure settings (follow-up threshold, internal domains)

### 4. Auditor Setup

Each auditor should:
1. Login with provided credentials
2. Configure email settings (IMAP/SMTP)
3. Upload company list CSV
4. Run first email sync
5. Check overdue follow-ups

## 🎓 How It Works

### Email Sync Flow

1. **Auditor triggers sync** → Click "Sync Emails Now"
2. **Connect to IMAP/SMTP** → Using encrypted credentials
3. **Fetch emails** → From INBOX and Sent folders
4. **Filter by company list** → Only emails from/to tracked companies
5. **Exclude internal domains** → Admin-configured domains removed
6. **Save to database** → Deduplicated by message ID
7. **Update checkpoint** → Next sync only fetches new emails

### Follow-Up Detection Logic

1. **For each company**:
   - Find last outgoing email date
   - Find last incoming email after that date
   - Calculate working days between them
   
2. **Mark as overdue if**:
   - No reply received, AND
   - Working days > threshold

3. **Working days exclude**:
   - Weekends (Saturday, Sunday)
   - Public holidays (from holidays.json)

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. **Change encryption keys** in `utils/encryption.py`
2. **Set strong admin password** (min 12 characters)
3. **Use HTTPS** (reverse proxy with SSL)
4. **Configure Streamlit secrets** for encryption key
5. **Enable firewall rules** (restrict to internal network)
6. **Regular backups** of database files

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for full security checklist.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Email Providers**
   - Some providers require "app passwords" (Gmail, Outlook)
   - 2FA may need additional configuration
   - Rate limits vary by provider

2. **Scalability**
   - SQLite works well up to ~50 concurrent users
   - For larger deployments, migrate to PostgreSQL

3. **Email Sync**
   - First sync limited to last 30 days (configurable)
   - Very large mailboxes (>10K emails) may be slow
   - Sync is synchronous (blocks UI during operation)
